        <p> Dr. Richner's work and achievements</p>
             <h3> A brief biography of Dr. Richner</h3>
  <div class=text-center;style= width:10px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; class="text-center">
    <ul> 
        <li>Beat Richner (born March 13, 1947) is a Swiss pediatrician, cellist (Beatocello), and founder of children's hospitals in Cambodia.</li>
      <li> After receiving his medical degree in 1973, Dr Richner specialized in pediatric care at the Zurich Children's Hospital.</li>
      <li> Following this, working for the Swiss Red Cross, he was sent to Cambodia where he worked at the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital in Phnom Penh in 1974 and 1975.</li>
      <li> When the Khmer Rouge overran Cambodia, he was forced to return to Switzerland where he continued his work at the Zurich Children's Hospital.</li>
      <li> In the process of pursuing his medical career and an interest in music and entertainment, Dr. Richner developed the character of "Beatocello", an artistic and comedic clown who played the cello.</li>
      <li>In December 1991 Richner returned to Cambodia and saw the devastation that had taken place following the ensuing conflicts with the Khmer Rouge and Vietnam. He was asked to re-open and re-build Kantha Bopha by the Cambodian government. </li>
      <li> Creating the Kantha Bopha Foundation in March 1992, Richner officially returned to Cambodia to begin reconstruction and Kantha Bopha was reopened in November 1992. Since then, the foundation has funded the expansion of Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals to include five hospitals in total.</li>
      <li>  The five children's hospitals built by Richner and the Kantha Bopha Foundation are located in Cambodia's major cities. All of the hospitals provide treatment free of charge.</li>
      <li> The Kantha Bopha hospitals treat half a million children per year free of charge. Approx. 100,000 seriously ill children are admitted. Japanese encephalitis, malaria, dengue fever and typhoid are common, often exacerbated by the presence of TB. TB is the number one killer. Mortality rate is an astonishingly low 1%. Richner says that over 80% of all pediatric health care in Cambodia is provided by his hospitals</li>
      <li>The hospitals are primarily funded by donations from individuals in Switzerland. Operational expense in 2006 was in the order of US$17m. Since the Foundation started in 1991, it has reportedly raised US$370 million.</li>
